This library is one of the [Harvest Libraries](https://github.com/LANDIS-II-Foundation/Libraries/wiki/HarvestLibraries). It provides data types for harvesting forests: management areas, stands, prescriptions. It also includes algorithms for stand ranking, stand selection and site selection.

Changes to this library are governed by the [**Repository Rules**](https://sites.google.com/site/landismodel/developers) from the Technical Advisory Committee.

Eric Gustafson is the custodian of this library as it is the basis for the harvest extensions.
